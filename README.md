# Brave Rofi menu

Opens [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) window that allows to switch brave browser tabs, even if you currently not focusing `brave` browser itself.
Works with [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3).

Requires running `brave` in debug mode:

`brave --remote-debugging-port=9222`
